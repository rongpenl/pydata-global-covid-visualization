# pydata-global-covid-visualization

COVID-19 Visualizations, the Good, the Bad and the Malicious Visualization is supposed to convert data into more informative, digestible format so readers without too much analytical training can grasp the ideas or situations the data contains. This is especially important during the age of crisis, like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The talk contains 4 parts.
0. Introduction of the porject
1. A short overview of basic scientific facts about COVID-19
2. A critical review of visualization examples
3. Lessons learned

An overview of basic scientific facts about COVID-19
I will go over some basic facts about COVID-19 which are backed by scientific evidence or scientific community consensus. For example, a brief timeline of the pandemic milestones, some virological facts about COVID-19 and public policy implementations.

A critical review of visualization examples
I will pick visualizations to review. They come from three sources: news media like CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc; (research) institutes like WHO or universities and independent data scientists.

The review is conducted from three perspectives.
- What is the information the visualization tries to convey?
- What data does it use? Does the data contain the intended information in principle?
- What kind of plot and aesthetic elements does the visualization use? Do such visual elements help or not?

3 Review data quality and reproducibility
Data source and data quality verification have been quite chaotic during the crisis. In this part, I will go over the process of reproducing a visualization in the previous section starting from verifying the quality of the data, choosing the right tools and picking the right aesthetics.

4 How not to embed opinions into visualization (data science projects)
" Without data you're just another person with an opinion".

I believe in a public crisis like COVID-19, The most important thing for data science is to precisely and exactly convey the objective information. Even when the data is of high quality and the visualization is correct, the data scientists should inform the readers the possible judgmental consequences of the data preprocessing, transformation and aesthetic choices. In many cases data scientists think this is unnecessary or omit such information. However, when the audience is general public, these self-discrediting footnotes become a corner-stone for reliability and trustworthiness.
