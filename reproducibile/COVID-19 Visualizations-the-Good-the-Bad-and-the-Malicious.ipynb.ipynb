It is also the hot topic in data analytics/science. Media, research institutes and data scientists created many visualization projects. Some projects are informative and creative, some are flawed. Quite a few are designed to mislead people without analytical skills. I think it is my duty to make a critical review of them.\n",

Another one is from an unknown source, claiming to be the number of installed 5G towers. **I couldn't identify the source of the image or the data source of the image**.\n",
